# Steganography_Project
The steganography project in C hides secret data inside an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. Each pixelâ€™s LSB is modified to store message bits without visibly changing the image. It uses fread() and fwrite() for file handling, ensuring secure data embedding and extraction.
